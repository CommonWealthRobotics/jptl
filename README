Java Polygon Triangulation Library.

Usage:

See the JavaDoc.

Background:

In doing some research that required the breakup of polygons in into convex
polygons, I could not find a library for performing this operation written
in Java.

It is based off of the following paper:

@article{Sei91,
AUTHOR = "R. Seidel",
TITLE = "A simple and Fast Randomized Algorithm for Computing Trapezoidal
         Decompositions and for Triangulating Polygons",
JOURNAL = "Computational Geometry Theory &amp; Applications",
PAGES = "51-64",
NUMBER = 1,
YEAR = 1991,
VOLUME = 1 }

and is (at least for reference) a psuedo-port of code written by  Narkhede A.
and Manocha D. at UNC-CH.
