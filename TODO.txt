TODO list (some from the code, some from the top of my head).

Need to:
- Finish the code port.
- Verify the trapazoid tree structure.  There are still some issues with the bottom of the tree.


Like to:
- Refactor.  Refactor.  Refactor.
- Add some logging (commons logging?).
- In PointUtil,  Replace greaterThan, etc with a Comparable call.
